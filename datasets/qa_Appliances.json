This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!"}

If not, how do you clean it?', 'answer': 'Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It\'s a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It\'s pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air.

The circulation fan starts clunking as it hits the ice buildup behind the deepfreezer. . I have to do a manual defrost. I have cut the holess much bigger and it's better, but still needs a manual defrost. This last time I made the holes enormous, so lets see if that helps. If I just left it alone, and not manual defrosted, the deice sensor burns out and and that costs $$$. It has already burnt out 2, thats why I have to fiddle with it.

While everybody's idea of a load is somewhat different, and working with the pounds specified by manufacturers is not always intuitively easy, I'd say that it would be about a half load or a bit less than a normal moderately sized load for a traditional model. Before you purchase this model, however, you should read my other comments here, along with some of the other notes. This washer is a rugged little machine, which is made in America to serve principally in janitorial operations as a mop head and rag washer for a janitor's closet. As such, it can be a very cheap and rugged alternative for home use, but IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WASHER, in the modern sense. It is much more akin to antique washers, as it is really just a pail with a timer controlled agitator and a drain hose. That's it. You have to fill it with water, drain it, fill it again to rinse, drain it, maybe rinse again, and all by hand, and then wring out your clothes and dry them."}

However, when I added 4 pairs of fleece pants the water registered at the maximum fill line. For me then, with my water tank on my boat, I have to remember that a single load of laundry using 3 fills to the minimum will use 30 gallons of precious water tank water. First fill is with laundry detergent; second fill I add 1 cup vinegar to assist the rinse out of detergent; and the final fill is to rinse out all vinegar/ soap residue. This vinegar technique does cut down on the lint retention on clothing. There is nothing else to capture lint. I would like to know what others do about laundry lint. I do wash dark clothes separately. The washer will take more than 4 pairs of fleece, I just filled the washer with water before adding clothes to see what amount of gallons I could use to the minimum fill line. I like my washer. It sure beats loading a harbor cart and walking half a mile to the nearest laundromat. I also use a spin-dry extractor which allows clothes on plastic hangers to hang dry overnight.'}

I have now had to throw it away and I am using Amazon to read customer reviews before purchasing online. I liked this for the first 2 months; the sound was noticeable but sounded like 'white noise', which didn't bother me. I followed the regular cleaning suggested by the manufacturer and thought all was good... until I noticed orange/pink mold forming in all the crevices I couldn't reach. I tried to take it apart (without disassembling the motor area, obviously) but there were still so many areas with the tint of color. I continued to use it and within about a week from this point, there was black mold spotted everywhere inside. I looked up how to clean it online and I came across the Amazon reviews. I noticed many people saying that this left a white film in the room and it finally clicked: Our wood furniture, baseboards and fan blades had been needing a lot of extra cleaning that I didn't think much about beforehand... but it's only in the room w/ the humidifier! I'll second all of the reviews on here expressing their opinions about how bad the white film and mold is with this product. The company wouldn't even let me return it without paying over $20 in shipping and they couldn't guarantee a refund/replacement."}

My small element openings on the cooktop measure 6 7/16" in diameter--just less than 6 1/2". To simplify things the drip pan manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening a 6" pan. My large element opening measures 8 7/16"--just less than 8 1/2" in diameter. The manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening an 8" pan. I would remove your elements and old pans, and measure the diameter of the openings. If they are like mine, then 6" and 8" pans will fit. By the way, these pans are of excellent quality.

Regardless, this should not be difficult. I picked up a garbage disposal install kit at Home Depot for about 15 bucks. It has a variety of PVC plumbing connections in various lengths and angles. You might have to jerry-rig some of the connections, but the kit comes with threaded connections and washers, so no PVC glue or primer is necessary. Just make sure you measure twice, cut once, and install the washers in the correct direction, and you should be able to make it work. I also found some excellent install videos on You-tube for my particular set up (double sink drains, with the disposal on the left side and the drain connection on the right). Good luck!'}

Please note the screws go only from one piece of the flange to the other not trespassing the sink bottom. The flange is for 4-1/2 drain valve sinks and the attachment of the Insinkerator is a "bayonet" type. I am almost sure all Insinkerators use the same mount type.

Is there an exhaust kit available with this model?', 'answer': 'The hood includes the exhaust mechanism, filter and light fixture, and once you install it (under a cabinet or all of the way to the ceiling) you must purchase the necessary exhaust pipe to either take the exhaust straight thru the roof, or get a 90 degree elbow (and the necessary pipe) to bend it (in the attic) in order to take the exhaust to the (side) eve of the house. Exhausting to the eve of the house is more economical and reduces the cost/risk of cutting thru the roof and the potential water leak etc. The elbow and aluminum exhaust pipes that I purchased at Home Depot (very economical) do not have to be sealed since they fit into one another tightly. One thing that I noticed on my hood is that the light switch occasionally stick when I try to turn the light on. Although I have not done it, I am sure that a bit of WD40 sprayed on the side of the switch would do the job. Considering the cost of this product, it is an excellent value. The unit is very easy to install. We are retired and we would buy this item again. We have stainless steel appliances and this hood matches seamless. To impress family and friends there are other hoods that would do the job at higher costs. I suggest that you follow the installation instructions as far as the distance of the hood from the top of the stove. Too close to the top of the stove will impede your working room, too far from the top of the stove, will diminish its power to exhaust the heat properly. It was suggested to us, and we followed, to install the hood where the very bottom of the hood is in line with your eye brows. It works fine, as exhausting the heat/smoke and it gives us plenty of working room with the pots etc. I hope this info helps.....'}

What is the difference between this PUR filter 4396841 for $35, the cheaper Pur PBSS one for $29 or the 4396710 for $35???', 'answer': 'If all the filters are original PUR* replacement filters, the filter medium will be the same. Someone has posted that the PBSS filter is inferior to the others, but I see no data to back up that assertion. The difference is in the amount of water they can filter before recommended replacement and the flow rate. The "universal" PBSS filter is rated at 100gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396710 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396841 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.85GPH flow rate. Strangely, both the 100 & 200 gal. capacity models are recommended for 6 months replacement. You would think the 200gal. models would last longer. Some whirlpool refrigerators offer what\'s called "fast-fill" systems, which dispense the water almost twice as fast as "normal" systems. It stands to reason that the 4396841 would be best if you want/need the higher flow rate. It also stands to reason that the lower flow rate models probably filter better since the cartridges (and presumably the filter mediums) are exactly the same size (educated opinion). I have decided on the 4396710 for my refrigerator. I researched a lot for this answer, I hope it helps.'}

The genuine OEM Whirlpool / KitchenAid 4396841 Refrigerator Ice & Water Filter replacement fits Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, and Kenmore side-by-side refrigerators with a push-button filter located in the grille at the bottom of the fridge. If you see the words "Fast Fill" or "PUR Measure" on your water dispenser, stick with this filter (4396841) because 4396841 has dual flow rates of 0.50 gpm and 0.85 gpm.

The filter does get clogged though...., March 6, 2012 By Benjamin D. Garlock (San Francisco, CA) - See all my reviews (REAL NAME) Amazon Verified Purchase(What\'s this?) This review is from: Haier HLP140E 2-3/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Tumble Vented Dryer (Kitchen) I\'ve had a great experience with this dryer and the washer that pairs with it. I live in a tiny studio apartment in Manhattan. The only problem is the wool filter in the back eventually becomes way too dirty to be useful. Even using the lint wand, it eventually just gets too chewed up. After a good deal of digging I found that you can replace the filter. If you Google the part number it is called a "Panel Top WD510023". They were about seven dollars with shipping. Other then that, it\'s a great dryer! " I\'m going to go and look up the part.'}

There\'s no need to vent this dryer and i don\'t even use a "Vent kit" I just place it up again the wall and use the adapter that comes with it to vent up from the back. The filter\'s screen makes it so little if no lint get\'s out. In the winter it\'s a free heater and humidifier, in the summer your central a/c should have no problem keeping the house cool. It put\'s out very little heat in the long run and if you just wait to you go to work/school to turn it on then it\'s literally no bother.'}

One thing i do that others may not be able to do is i wash a load or 2 before i go to sleep with and toss the wet laundry in the dryer and wait till i leave in the morning before i turn it on. When i leave in the morning i turn the A/C off anyways so even if it increases the temp and humidity in the apartment i never notice it. Coming home turn the A/C on and fold clothes and everything is good. If it helps you the dryer uses about as much electricity as a hair dryer or a space heater (My kill-a-watt says between 900-1000w during use). The matching washer uses literally a fraction of that. I also use auto dry instead of timed dry and have never had a problem with it. But more to the point after one full load from my 1cf haier washer i used about .75kwh or about 9 cents to dry it."}

Yes, I believe it will be able to hold your temperature range of 50 to 55 degrees. It will probably be able to do that without having to disassemble the thermostat too. You will need, however, to monitor the temperature until it gets to your desired range. I have one of those atomic clock things that has an outside temperature transmitter. I just put that transmitter inside the kegerator. Mine keeps track of the temp range in the past 12 hours and resets at midnight each day. I just went down and checked mine. Now, keep in mind that I actually have mine set to keep my beer in the mid 30\'s. I like cold beer! Anyway, the range of mine since midnight last night has been between 31 and 38 degrees. It was precisely 33 degrees when I just checked. It holds that pretty consistently day in and day out now that I have my dial set correctly. By the way, it is a rotary dial, with "colder and warmer" direction. There is no temp set. So it may take you some trial and error but I think you should be able to get there pretty quickly.

My husband said, "Get the 5 burner" - I didn\'t want to, as I\'d never been short on burners when cooking, even for groups. (I was always running out of oven space so we did get a double oven - reg. sized - LOVE it!) Well, even the sales person didn\'t explain to me the advantages of the 5 burner; it\'s more than just a burner. With induction, it is more important to match an sizes, but . .more importantly, you can only use "H" (the energy boost for rapid heating" on one burner at a time in a section. On the 4-burner cooktop, there are 2 "sections" (I am sure there is a technical term for it) - on the 5 burner, there are 3 sections - so . . you can put more burners on "H" at the same time, and yep - I needed to one day when cooking for a crowd. Of course, you make do with what you have - but I sure wish I\'d gone w/the 5 burner for the times I need it. And . . I LOVE the "L" (lowest) setting - holds things perfectly, and I no longer need to melt choc. over a double boiler. I just put it in the pan on the stove -L setting. And .. I while many pans will work w/induction, I\'d recommend the best you can afford. We have been very frugal our entire lives - and did buy Demeyere pots and pans.

If you\'re in the habit of routinely loading up the disposer with all sorts of waste and expecting it to handle it, the 3/4 HP or even 1 HP model is a better choice. On the other hand, you really should never load up a disposer like this and should not discard larger solids through the disposer anyway. The disposer itself may be able to handle large amounts of solid waste, but your drain pipes won\'t like it and you\'re very likely to have flow problems and/or blockages over time if you use your disposer this way.'}

The sensor has about 2' of cord. You close the door on the cord. The display comes with sticky velcro pads so you can stick it anywhere on the fridge (most likely on top or on the side). I used a glue gun to affix the sensor and cord so that they would stay put (the suction cup does not stay on). You may need to adjust the location of the sensor in order to get the reading you desire as it can vary depending on how close it is to cold blowing air, the door jam and also the height. For my upright units, I found that a location towards top, halfway towards the back of the unit gave me the most consistent readings."}

Feel for wetness with your fingers to find out where the water is coming from- if it is above where the hose connects, which in this case it most likely is, the faucet needs to be replaced, or at least new gaskets installed- I'd replace the faucet if that is the case. If that is dry, but is wet only at or below where you've attached the hose to the faucet, then the hose connector is where the leak is occurring. In this case, you probably will only need to replace a 25 cent rubber washer. Dry everything with paper towel or rag before checking where the leak I coming from. Plumbers tape is not an option- your seal is the rubber washer between the hose and the faucet, always check to make sure the rubber washers are in place. Hope this helps..."}

Also note that the rack has to be oriented in one direction, front-to-back -- there are posts on the sides to keep things from sliding out.

I'm looking for one that makes small (like Sonic) ice. Maybe slightly bigger.", 'answer': "There are two sizes it makes. The largest one is probably no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in length. Each cube has a opening at one end and is hollow. The cubes are more like hardened slush than regular ice cubes and do not last very long in a room temperature or even chilled liquid. The other end is rounded as are the sides except for the opening side which is flat. The holding basket for cubes made is directly over the water level compartment so the cubes are very watery and start to melt if not removed immediately. The basket in the water holding compartment directly under the door lid on top of the unit is not cooled except by the cubes that are made and put into the basket by the device. Taking the cubes out of the device and putting them in our freezer as they are made is a small task, but once in the freezer each individual cube freezes solid and to each other also due to their watery condition so you have to use a tool or pick to separate them from each other and any others that were already in the ice cube container in the freezer. I did not find any other brand that was very much better except very large devices used mostly by dinning places. This device works, but don't expect regular frozen cubes nor the ease of storing them very long as a normal freezer would store them."}

If so, it\'s because you didn\'t let it sit for 24 hours after you took it out of the box. During transit, if it\'s turned upside down or on it\'s side, the gear oils run everywhere.

Why is water pooling under deli drawer in refrigerator?', 'answer': "there are two things. both are easy fixes and one fix is easier than the other. first, open your fridge drawers and see if they kindve come back. if they dont at all, then your problem is that the unit is too level. just get a pair of pliers or a wrench the correct size and twist the front feet of the unit higher than the back. if the doors swing back, then the unit can drain properly. if that isnt the case, then you have to clean two tubes found behind the unit. if you take off the large plate on the back of the unit, you'll find two white rubber tubes. make sure the fridge is unplugged for this. take those tubes and any assembly pieces out and wash them with hot soapy water. rinse them well. allow them to dry and reinsert them. those things clog every couple of years if there is a lot of sediment in your water. we have had to do both. we've had our fridge three and a half years and still love it. little maintenance, but overall nice. there is no drain cup to dump, and other than replacing the water filter every six months, it is pretty maintenance free. just make sure the front is higher than the back and clean your tubes every couple of years--esp if you have hard water in your area."}

When you see the element they should provide a drawing of the various parts in this assembly. From what I have seen these are much a standard part. You might want to try this trick, if this is the only part you need to replace. This is some type of fuse to keep your dryer from overheating. Take it out and if you can test the leads, if you can. If not the top should be flat and yours may now be more domned. If this is the case throw in on a concrete floor three or four times. This causes the dome to flatten and if you did measure the ohms should see a change from negative to positive. Bottom line no need to replace this part, if this is all that is wrong.'}

Now, elements usually break for the lack of cooling or air flow, so if you put a new element but nobody at home is removing the old lint, the new element is going to burn again. Use your hand and arm and make sure there is no blockage whatsoever inside the duct. Regarding model, before I purchased I went to several sites and found that they are very similar. I thank God, that the guy selling the element in this site, is not running a nuclear power plant, because it would have been smarter to take a picture of the element, than to take a picture of the box, right?

Included is plastic tubing and fitting, but no instructions on how to install.", 'answer': "First of all...what is the problem? Are the valves not turning on and off, or is the water just not flowing to the icemaker. My problem was both. Since the water dispenser was working, I 'tested' the old icemaker valve by disconnecting the water dispenser valve's electrical clip and attached it to the icemaker connection. Then pushing the water dispenser lever on the front of the refrigerator I got no water flow and knew the icemaker valve was faulty. Once I replaced the valves and reconnected the water lines, still no water was going to the icemaker. I disconnected the ice water line and tried to blow air through it. Blow hard as there may be water still in the line. I couldn't get air to pass through. Turned out the water line also was frozen on top of the freezer. I unscrewed and removed the icemaker cover to get access to the black water dispensing tube. Usuing a stiff wire and hair drier for about 15 minutes I was finally able to melt the ice in the water supply tube. Problem also could be the electronic control board. If you need to check if that is the problem, set icemaker to ON and pour about a cup of water into the ice cube tray. You should have a set of ice cubes form and ejected within an hour.

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B001HPD4HI', 'answerTime': 'Jan 8, 2014', 'unixTime': 1389168000, 'question': 'why it does not stay on high continually', 'answer': "I suspect what you are seeing and asking about is that if you turn the burners on high and just watch them, they glow red quickly but then seem to turn off and on instead of staying bright red and this is different than you are used to on the old-fashioned type of burner. Stoves are automatic systems that turn the electric current on and off as needed to keep the burner at a desired temperature. They don't adjust the amount of electricity applied to the burner...they turn on the power full-blast or completely off. A sensor monitors the temperature and turns the power on if it is too low or turns it off if it is too high. The radiant cook top is a special kind of element that can get VERY hot VERY fast (much faster than the old kind). The temperature sensor is near the element below the glass and the element gets hotter than the hottest setting quickly and turns of the power even though the pot of food above the glass is still not super hot. So you will see the burner get red then go off several times before your food finishes cooking. This is normal. Even though it seems like it would get hot faster if it just stayed on continuously, that would actually be bad because the element would overheat and burn out. Old style burners do the same thing, but you don't notice it as much because they take longer to cool down and stop glowing red so it seems like they are always on when you set them to high (but they aren't). The same thing that makes them stay red longer, also makes them take longer to get hot so if the new element was made to be a lot slower to heat up, it would seem to stay red and it would work like the old kind (but it would take longer to cook your food)."}

The Danby is one of the best decisions I ever made! (Hmmm...of course the Best decision I ever made was when I met my wife and we both knew we were Soul Mates for life!)

The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is constructed so well that there seems to be no reason why it would not do perfectly well in a garage. If I had a garage, I would put the Danby Freezer in it too. Also, the Freezer is Silent when it is on! It makes a very low noise after you open the door and close it, that it sounds like it is making it airtight. The Danby Freezer has heavy duty plastic sliders that move smoothly when pushing the Freezer on a floor, they also adjust in height if a floor is a little off balanced. I feel the sliders on the Danby Freezer would not move easily on a dry cement floor, unless it was painted to a durable and smooth finish. Therefore, I would protect the floor that you put the freezer on from dry cement, corrosion and dampness. I would set the Danby Freezer on top of a 1/4" inch thick Plexiglass plastic flooring or something similar. The Danby Freezer is easy to clean and defrosts rather quickly. You can place a small one inch tall long baking pan set on the floor with the door open and any water draining out can be caught in the pan. There are no ice chunks forming inside the Freezer either. It just has a frosty coating or snowy look around the walls and elements inside the Freezer that melt off the interior when it is defrosting. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is the Best Freezer I ever had! You will not be disappointed. Best regards and Happy Holidays for the New Year! ~ Marc'}

Personally; I don't think I would try to trim it myself for fear of damaging or destroying the piece. I hope this is of some help to you. A sheet metal shop wouldn't charge you much, if anything, to trim it for you."}

I also presume you know how to get to the part by removing the access panel and some insulation. The part should be on the left side. When you remove the old valve out you need to understand that taking the screws out is not enough to remove it. You need to "unhook" (if I can say it) from the frame it is mounted on. Try t wiggle it up and down gently and to the sides and you will be able to detach it from the frame. This way you will be able to bring the valve closer to yourself and you will be able to see and access the electric plug and incoming water hose and out coming water hose. So, unplug the plug that supplies the voltage to the old valve by squeezing the "locks" on the plug. The plug unplugs similarly to the telephone line from the phone outlet or network cable. Keep in mind that the plug might be stuck. So, you may want to move it to the sides gently. If it does not come out it may mean that you are not squeezing it right (find that release latch). Then you need to take off the incoming water supply hose and outcoming water hose. One of them can be twisted off using adjustable wrench while the other (thinner one) has a wire based spindle (I hope I call it right), which secures the hose on the valve. Some remaining water will come out. So, it is a good idea to have a towel in that area to capture that water before disconnecting the hoses. Then you do everything in reverse using the new valve. Make sure that the thin hose fits all the way on the new valve and is secured with the wire spindle again. This may require some effort to do it. Also when you put the thick hose back be gentle and do not over tighten the nut of the hose.'}

The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn't, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I've had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren't really clean at all. For me, obtaining a spin dryer was the key to the whole process. You need to see the water being released from the cloths to decide if they need rinsed another time! Hope this helps. :-)"}

Personally, I wouldn't buy it again because of the load balancing issue, even if it doesn't break. When this one bites the dust, I'm going to look for one that is shorter and fatter (since I think the shape of it is a factor in why it's hard to balance the load), and if I can't find one, I'm just going to let my clothes line dry."}

They won\'t be dripping wet, but they\'ll still be very damp. You may want to get that spinner like some others have suggested to push more water out of your heavy garments. Also, if your laundromat is nearby but you just don\'t want to sit around for hours waiting for your stuff, you could do a few loads in your washer, put the items in a plastic bag, and run down there to dry them (sitting in front of the dryer so no one rips you off) for a half hour or so. I make do with my HAIER and a clothesline very nicely, and am able to set up a clothes rack that can handle the laundry of two people very well during the winter months. For very heavy things, though, if I had a lot of them, I\'d probably do the "run to the laundromat and use the dryer" trick.'}

They assured me that the Haier HLP21N Pulsator portable washer is 100% electrical with no need for batteries. They also went on to say that this machine does not keep "memory settings" like in there other models that do. So, in a nutshell, this was a typo left on the manual and rest assured that your washer does not need batteries for any reason. Happy Washing ! George'}

Everything is clean, and I can add extra water, softener or bleach when I want to, not when the machine dictates it through a cup holder. " I like extra bleach at times when needed. " You wont be disappointed with this machine. It CLEANS clothes unlike the water savers today. I wish it held a larger load like the old monster sized "heavy duty" machines but it in fact cleans well. No bells and whistles but clean clothes and spins like the dickens so ready for the dryer. It\'s worth every penny !! You will NOT find a washer like the ones from 30 years ago...I already spent near a year trying.

Turned to off and the furnace works and water keeps flowing to aprilaire.', 'answerType': 'Y', 'answer': "This humidistat runs off 24V AC and often has it's own step down power supply when the blower board doesn't support it. Check if you are getting 24V AC coming up to the humidistat. The solenoid for the water should be closed unless the blower motor comes on. The transformer is hooked directly at the blower board for aux power 115V. Check your manual for the diagram. If it's blowing the breaker, the blower board is probably detecting a problem with the step down transformer 115 to 24 AC. I'd be checking there. The humidistat acts like a light switch and that's just a simple circuit, open or closed. When you turn the knob you can hear it click, that's opening and closing the circuit to directly to the water solenoid. If the solenoid is stuck open, the solenoid is probably blown. The people who installed ours (before we bought the house) hooked it up without the 24V AC step down. 115V directly to the solenoid and poof it's gonna blow. When it blows, its stuck open leaving water constantly flowing. Here are two links to products that are comparable to what I referenced. Hope that helps.

Is it possible that it's doing any permanent damage inside the machine?", 'answer': "Hi, Chris. With dryers, a squeak is almost always a sign of damage being done. The only possible exception is if your bearing needs only grease, which means damage is being done but slowly. In order, the three typical places to look for a dryer squeak are: the tension wheel (which holds the belt tight around the drum), the front of the drum (which usually rides on a plastic collar behind the front panel of the dryer, though sometimes rides on two wheels underneath), and, of course, the bearing behind the center of the drum. Usually the cause is obvious. If it's not obvious, it's usually the bearing. Try greasing it if nothing else seems to be the problem. Best of luck."}

I have had absolutist no problems with it and I love it. If you are a serious cook, you will love it as well. I love the way I can control the heat of the range and I believe it rivals any gas cook top. I would much prefer the cook top of this range to a gas cook top as the solid surface is easy to maintain, it has warning signals if something boils over and nothing heats up if a pan is not on the surface. I have a very powerful microwave and have done a head to head comparison of bringing water to a boil. This range beats the microwave hands down. In fact, your cooking style will change due to the rapid pace of heating. I love the control I have when making heat sensitive dishes such as gravies, stove top custards and dishes that require high control of heat. The first couple weeks I kept calling my wife over to look at how much better things were cooking up. The ovens are excellent as well. I have not used the lower oven much at all but it would be handy if you are cooking for a large group or need to keep something warm while something else occupies the large oven. Some cool unexpected things regarding this oven is it can be used as a food dryer as well as to proof bread (low heat for yeast breads to rise). The oven has more controls than any mere mortal would ever use. It actually has certain modes for some religious holidays; not making that up. I have seen no downside to the ovens. They are awesome. After three years of use, I truly see no down side to this range at all. I understand that there is a range out there now that will heat a pan no matter where it is placed on the surface. I guess that would be cool but probably would not change the way I cook at all. I highly suggest this range. It would get 6 stars on a 5 star scale.'}

The edge if your counter may need to be flat and not curve up too. There may be accessories to accommodate the curve but you\'d have check on electrolux\'s website. There should be a fitment guide pdf guide there. The main concern is the slide in is designed slide over the counter so its nearly flush with the counter. If you have tile with a round edge on the left and right if the stove you won\'t be able to get the stove top flat with the counters and it won\'t look right. Even if you satisfy the flat countertop requirement, you will ideally want a small strip of countertop behind the stove to fill the gap between the backsplash and the back of the stove. Slide in ranges are designed to look like counter top stoves and the trim piece on the stove is designed to be flush with the countertop on 3 sides (left, behind, right). Although I\'ve seen optional accessories for placing a "dummy" filler piece behind the stove to fill the gap on back, you\'d have to check the website or ask an appliance retailer. With all that being said, I would just buy the Electrolux free standing induction version if that is the stove/counter configuration you have now. It will be a direct replacement.

(1) It should be a drop-in replacement for existing conventional cooktop; it uses 220V and 40A (or maybe 30A -- check the manual) (2) I'd guess it is slightly more efficient because it doesn't have to heat anything but the pot. There's some inefficiency in the induction mechanism, but I'd guess this is less than the inefficiency of heating the air and whatnot around a conventional electric element. (3) I wouldn't worry about your electric bill. It's not going to be noticeably different than conventional electric, and, even if you are blazing away at 6000 watts (4 burners going full) you are looking at less than $1/hour at the worst of USA electric rates. Do the math on, say, boiling 4 quarts of water and you'll see it's a few pennies."}
{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B003FW6ZV8', 'answerTime': 'Jan 4, 2014', 'unixTime': 1388822400, 'question': 'What type of pans do I need ?', 'answer': 'Induction-compatible cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words, it contains iron, or has a layer with magnetic properties. Cast iron, enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible (But not all types - for instance, All-Clad\'s MC2 line, which is made of aluminum and stainless steel, is not induction compatible). Aluminum, copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties. To tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible, hold a magnet to the bottom. If it clings, the cookware will work on an induction cooktop. Also, many manufacturers have started putting a n "induction compatible" symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they\'ll note compatibility on their packaging. The symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil. If you have an induction cooktop, but a favorite piece of cookware doesn\'t work on it, don\'t fret - Mauviel makes a product called the Mauviel Induction Disc (Compare Prices), which can be placed on the cooktop under the pan; the heating reaction will then heat the contents of the pan.

The Sabbath feature may only be used with the BAKE pad. The oven temperature may be set higher or lower after setting the Sabbath feature (the oven temperature adjustment feature should be used only during Jewish Holidays), however the display will not visibly show or provide any audible tones indicating whether the change occurred correctly. Once the oven is properly set using Bake with the Sabbath feature active, the oven will remain continuously ON until cancelled. This will override the factory preset 12-Hour Energy Saving feature. If the oven light will be needed during the Sabbath, press Oven light pad before activating the Sabbath feature. Once the oven light is turned ON and the Sabbath feature is active, the oven light will remain ON until the Sabbath feature is turned OFF. If the oven light needs to be OFF, be sure to turn the oven light OFF before activating the Sabbath feature. IMPORTANT NOTES: It is not advised to attempt to activate any other program feature other than BAKE while the Sabbath feature is active. ONLY the following key pads will function after setting the Sabbath feature; UP or DOWN ARROW, BAKE, START & CLEAR/OFF pads. ALL OTHER KEYPADS will not function once the Sabbath feature is properly activated. To Program the Oven to Begin Baking Immediately & activate the Sabbath feature 1. Be sure that the clock is set with the correct time of day. 2. Place the food in the oven. 3. Press Bake pad. "---" will appear, "UPPER" and "bake " will flash in the display. 4. Press the Up or Down arrow pad until the desired temperature appears. "UPPER" and "BAKE" will flash in the display. 5. Press Start pad or wait 5 seconds. "UPPER" and "BAKE" stop flashing and the icon will appear in the display. 6. If you desire to set the oven control for a Timed Bake or Delayed Start Bake do so at this time. If not, skip this step and continue to step 7. Refer to the Timed Bake (complete steps 6-8) / Delayed Start Bake (complete steps 6-11) section for complete instructions. Remember the oven will shut down after using Timed Bake or Delay Start Bake and therefore may only be used once during the Sabbath/Jewish Holidays. The maximum Delayed Start Bake time is 11 hours & 59 minutes. 7. The oven will turn ON and begin heating.'}

There are two needles. One that automatically follows the changes in atmospheric pressure while the other one remains fixed until moved by hand. 4. Set the movable dail by hand to coincide with the needle marking the current pressure. 5. Watch for the needle that follows the pressure changes to move up or down from that fixed point.

Will a washboard wear out my clothes but get them cleaner?', 'answer': 'The MobileWasher\'s delicate cycle generates it\'s power from precise wrist action. While cocking the wrist and utilizing a "GI Joe" type hand grip the user can accurately desoil most fine fabrics. Heavier soiling however requires a looser, more modified dual wrist action that is best used in combination with a "Kung foo" style grip. Full on elbow motion only enhances the efficiency on this stain setting. An open leg stance with hip sway AND full back arching are required to attain a vigorous agitation cycle. In either case, this washer\'s shaft is sturdy, rock hard, smooth and comfortable to grip. This alone easily separates it from the barbarian like action of a washboard, thus making it an efficient, caring washer for all your filthy fabrics.'}

I don\'t think so - seems some folks just use the bathtub! I measured the plastic tub I use (which I put in the bathtub) - it is a 12"x17" rectangle that is 12" deep. I can wash a load of undies, or a couple shirts and slacks or a queen sheet in the tub without even filling it clear up. I would think if you use a laundry sink, which might be bigger, you would just keep the water more shallow. You can tell when you have the water high enough to plunge the clothes around easily. In fact, I was just reading the newer reviews here and I like the idea of putting a laundry basket inside the washing tub so you can lift out the clothes to empty the water. You could certainly do that inside a laundry tub! Also, I just did a couple loads yesterday and am still enjoying the mobile washer - short handle and all. My handle has not loosened, but I\'m sure I can fix it if it does. I really do like this device - it keeps my inner hippy chick alive in my social security aged body!'}

Do you ring them dry with your hands and then hang them?', 'answer': "Hanging them outside to dry is the best way. A mechanical wringer would get them dry enough for an automatic dryer, but good ones are not cheap or readily available. While hand-wringing sort of works on woven fabrics, it's not a good idea for knits because they get stretched out of shape. Debbie is right about the dripping, and it's hard to wring heavy fabrics like denim jeans. Knit sweaters and tops can be squeezed to get much of the water out, and if you wrap a clean dry towel around them you can squeeze out even more, then hang the towel to dry with the rest of the laundry."}

The circumference of the thread from the stick it comes with is 2 & 3/8 inches. The width and space between each thread is 1/8 inch. I tried it in the bathtub and it does not work as well as in the 5 gallon bucket. Actually, you will do more energy work in the bathtub.

It's not too involved and even if your mechanical abilities are moderate, you should be OK. If you are a total klutz then pay the repair guys or replace the unit. And if you are fairly good at that stuff it should take between 15 and 30 minutes. In any case no previous dishwasher knowledge is necessary. I learned that one thing that wrecks the chopper is paper (usually from paper labels on jars or containers). It gets partially disintegrated from the water and soap and as the paper bits go through the chopper they ball up which get between the blades and push them off the shaft. Good luck. BTW: KithenAid, Kenmore, and Whirlpool dishwashers are all made by Whirlpool. The interiors of all those units appear to be the same with the same repair procedures."}

The fact that the part is about $50 to $ 100 cheaper than what anyone else is asking is a good reason to gamble on the part . If you do not alter it in any way it can still be returned for a refund if inoperable . The only thing that might be altered is the connector that plugs into it and that is in the wiring not in the part .

It's not a question of IF you need to replace the filter, but when you need to replace, you got to shut the water off near the filter to do it. Or else you'll have water spewing out everywhere.

The life of the carbon block media is dependent mostly on your specific water quality. In other words, the worse your input water is, the less it will last. Still, even this is an oversimplification as different types of contaminate will effect the carbon media differently. This is all to say that this particular filter may only last 4 months if your property is using a non-municipal water source (i.e. well water). Perhaps if your use is so irregular, maybe looking into one of the more simple, standard, 10 or 20" filter housings would be best. Big box hardware stores will usually have 10" carbon block or GAC filters in stock and you could simply change the filter at any time. In any case I would recommend changing out the filter prior to first use after its sat for 8 months unused. Carbon block filters, even ones with anti-bacteria additives, can build up dangerous amounts of bacteria given enough time (and I think 8 months is more than enough). Carbon filters that have sat in stale water for that long should be changed out (and filter housings cleaned with bleach if applicable) prior to consuming any water from that system.'}

How ever if you have particulates that give off radon, it captures those. Capture is dependent on the filter pore size- info I do not have at hand right now. Thus if you are fitering water from a well it would reduce the radon due to reduced particles. Not because it can capture gases. Most filters that use charcoal can capture radon gas, but they have a very limited life span. ( of course the more water you filter the shorter the life span.)'}

After reading the other responses, I have to say that I do NOT agree with them. I have had this machine since May 2013. I have NEVER had any issues with it. I do 5 to 8 loads of laundry every weekend. Never had a breakdown, never had clothes 'get holes in them', never had clothes 'disappear'. I use the Regular Light, Casual Light, and Delicate cycles mostly. Handles a large loads like towels (8 large) just fine on the 'super' water setting on the Normal Light cycle. Same goes for large loads of jeans (8 pairs) Takes just under an hour for the light cycles to finish, and less with the Delicate. The loads get cleaned well. The lid does lock, but only after the washer has finished filling and the cycle begins. Lid locks are now standard on ALL new washing machines per Federal safety law. I follow the manufacturers instructions and use the washer as it was intended using common sense that dictates to NEVER overload a clothes washer as to not cause undo stress on the machine or your laundry. Another thing to know is that this washer has a standard agitator in the middle of the basket. There is a similar model to this one that is a High Efficiency machine that does not have an agitator and that machine gets a lot of bad reviews as well. I have found that some comments for this machine are really pertaining to that other machine. To be fair, I have owned the washer for under a year, and there have been some comments that this machine starts having problems after a year's time. So I'll just have to see about that and cross that bridge IF I get to it. On a side note, I have the matching 7.0 Gas Dryer and it is a VERY GOOD dryer. Simple to use and dries our laundry effectively. I hope this answer helps you. Thank you"}

I have this RO tap within 10 in of a Moen oil rubbed bronze faucet. The Moen does have small aluminum flakes in the coating giving it the appearance of gold flakes. The two blend so well I thought the RO tap had gold flakes also. However it doesn't. It appears to have very small particle size mica in the coating. On cars, the mica would give the coating a subtle sparkle versus aluminum which can be small particle size giving the subtle reflectiveness or the in your face large particle aluminum that sparkles not just that little shimmer. Taking into account the sparkle/shimmer effect of mica and aluminum flake it would easily be an industry match since untrained eyes cannot pick up the minute color differences. So I would say it doesn't have a solid chocolate brown appearance and it is not an exact match to my Moen faucet. But unless you get up close with a light to reflect off of the coating, you'd consider it a good match. Aside from that, you cna always return it if the subtle differences bother you."}

Which filter should I use on the washing machine cold water inlet line?', 'answer': "This requires a multifaceted answer. First of all, how large is the sediment your well draws in? These filters are available in several different screen or mesh filter sizes. If it is sandy, you need to compare the size of the sand to the micron size of the filter element. I'd say this is the most important research that you need to do. Next I'd ask how much sand gets drawn in say daily, then over the course of a week. Thus could be determined by how much sand is in your toilet tanks, (when you take the lid off and look inside); then how often do you clean the screens on the washer? Lastly, do you see sand in the faucet arreaters? If the answer is a great deal to any of the above questions, I would advise you to get a filter which is one pipe size larger then then waterline coming from your pressure pump/ inlet to your house. This will allow a longer time between flushing intervals of the filter. I have used them in this application in the past, with great results for our customers. If it is installed correctly, the drain on the bottom would be run to the outside,or a nearby drain. Be sure to install a union on the drain line to allow for occasional disassembly. When the filter shows signs of being clogged- sediment in the bottom, color in the screen; then you flush it out for 1-2 minutes, until clear. I hope this helps you. I am a plumber in northern Arizona, and would recommend this item."}

How does your system work?', 'answer': 'If you do not want to use salt or any other chemicals, this is the only other method you can use that has tested and proven results. The media acts as a catalyst to give something for the calcium and magnesium molecules to start their binding process on. Once they start binding the filter media, the break off as molecules bound together in your water so they do not look for other surfaces to cling to. Thus, you prevent scale build up on your appliances, etc. These work great for preventing damaging scale build up. The standard system works good in lower hardness ranges up to 25 gpg.

The part number for the Kenmore is: W10335147A - Does anyone know if this is the same filter?', 'answer': "I have a Kenmore Elite as well, it is a 35 sq ft. side by side Refrigerator Freezer. I found on Amazon that the W10311524 has precisely the same demensions as the W103335147A. I therefore purchased three of the W10311524 on ebay postpaid for around $19.00. When they arrived I opened one and found it to be precisely the same right down to the number of pleats in the filter. It fit perfectly and even came with an identical triangular filter status indicator like the W10335147A that SEARS sells postpaid for $12.50 each. It appears that Whirpool now builds refrigerators for Frigidare, Kenmore and Kitchenade as well, and probably has different part numbers on this filter for each brand! I am now looking for a sheet of the filter material containing the activated carbon. If I can find it it should be an easy matter to cut the filter material with a paper cutter and then fan fold it. The white plastic case can be easily taken apart and washed, the new fanfolded filter inserted, and then the rebuilt filter easily installed for a cost of $0.25 a change or less. Off course one would not have a valid indicator gauge, but adding a reminder to change filters every six months on one's smart phone could easily fix that! Finally, I would not run any of these refrigeratoirs with a filter very long. The filter has two purposes the first to keep dust and debrie from accumulating on the internal condensing coils and secondly to eliminate refigerator oders using the activated charcoal. These new refrigerators have a closed system so that one no longer have to brush and vacuum these coils. This especially nice for us as our siamese cat's favorite spot is just to the left of our refrigerator."}

The water dispenser just trickles water. It also makes a little noise while it dispenses water. I tried defrosting water line. That is not the answer. The Ice maker &amp; dispensor works fine....', 'answer': 'Several possible causes of problems with water to dispenser. Troubleshooting tips: 1. Check to see if the ice maker is still working. If so, the problem is probably not caused by a water filter problem since the water to the ice maker has to go through the filter also. 2. Disconnect water tubing connector at bottom of refrigerator where it enters the freezer door. Then press water dispenser switch. If water comes out of the disconnected line then the problem is probably a frozen water line in the freezer door. Reconnect the line and defrost the freezer. If the problem occurs again there are other measures that can be taken to prevent freezing. 3. Turn off power, remove cover and valve bracket on the back of the unit, and pull the valve assembly out where you can get to it. There are two valves. The first valve is the inlet valve and must open whenever the ice maker or the water dispenser operates. The second valve has two separate outlets - one for the ice maker and one for the freezer. There is a short tubing from the outlet of the first valve to the inlet of the second valve. Disconnect this tubing by pressing in on the connector while pulling out on the tube. Direct the open end of the tube toward a pan. Then keeping clear of all electrical wires, plug the refrigerator back in. Press the water dispenser. If water does not come out of the inlet valve, the valve is probably bad. If it does come out, it is probably the second valve. You can run a similar test on the second valve if the first valve proves to be okay. 4. If you are comfortable with your do-it-yourself skills, you can also use a voltmeter to confirm that the valve is receiving 110 volts when the water dispenser is depressed. I even went so far as to jumper the water dispenser connector to the ice maker side of the valve to confirm that that side would open when I depressed the water dispenser. Be careful if you try these because you are working with 110 volt power. If the valve is not getting 110v power when the dispenser is depressed, it is probably due to either a bad controller board or a bad electrical connection.'}

So you don't need to worry about turning it off right away. It will have the water stopped when it's done.

There is a 10 second delay before it starts. You leave the water on until it beeps several times, telling you it's finished. You turn off dishwasher, turn off water, push the red release button on coupler (releases any water pressure) then you uncouple and then I pull the hose upward from the back to drain water still in hose. Certain cycles heat the water so you'll want to pull open the door and let the steam out and the dishes (hot) will finish drying. The manual is not written well, but it's not rocket science, so you'll figure it out.

Or do you have to buy a separate spin dryer to remove the water from your clothes?', 'answer': 'No, this washer does not have a spin dry function. Also, as a clothing washer I would highly recommend the Panda or Basecamp washers over this model. None of them have spin dry, so you will need a separate spinner. The small blue spinner works well. It operates at 1,600 RPM. This is quite a bit faster than a typical washing machines spin cycle. Those are normally about 600 RPM. The larger stainless steel drum spinner operates at 3,200 RPM and leaves your clothes dry enough to wear in a pinch. They will hang dry in only about an hour out of the faster machine. Buy whichever one suits your needs. Be aware that capacity wise the 3,200 RPM model more closely matches that of the Panda / Basecamp washer. Hope this helps!'}

In this particular instance this one is re-branded and being sold with a 220 micron pouch for use as an extraction machine to make "bubble hash" out of marijuana. You can of course use it safely to wash your baby clothes. However, I would recommend the Panda or Basecamp washing machines over this model. This one has been marked up in price for no real reason, and the mesh bag will be of no use to you. It is not tough enough for clothing use. The Panda and basecamp machines are less expensive, and better models when it comes to reliability and motor power for clothes. This model is only about $30 USD in China! (Talk about killer profit here!) Anyway, I hope this helps you! Oh and on another note, none of these machines have a spin dry function. You will want to pick up the small blue spinner (1,600 ROM)for lighter things like the baby clothes, or the bigger 3,200 RPM for when you need things almost completely dry out of the spinner, or larger things spun. The larger spinner is much more expensive, and even the smaller one drys things much more than a typical washing machine spin cycle.'}

Plus all Speed Queen top loaders have a soak cycle that should help with the grease but I have not had to use it yet. One minor nit with the soak cycle is that after it is done you then have to run the load through a entire regular cycle but an easy workaround suggested by other owners is to use the regular cycle but lift the lid on the washer after the initial fill to let the load soak. After it soaks for a while just close the iid to run the load through the rest of the cycle. You can't do this with a modern HE machine.

None of the other models operate with the constant slow agitation feature in a complete cycle.

However, the loudest part is actually quite loud, and lasts maybe 30 seconds. The first time I heard it, I thought something was wrong with the washer, but after talking to a technician, was assured it was normal. I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly. This sound of water hitting the tub is startling, and probably child-waking loud if it's near their room."}

The only time setting is in-between the low shut off point and the high turn on point. If you were heating in a refrigerator with an element then it shuts off it is here you have control of the time..(it\'s called controlling the "short cycle")..after it shuts off there will be some residual heat at first then it will be absorbed or dissipate in short time...like 8-10minutes. So you set the "lag" time for like 15minutes, so then the controller will not check the temperature for 15min. THEN turn off if it needs to cool down more. That is the only time control in this controller. The only way to work in your case is you would need to place a 10min. timer between your controller and the pump. the problem being is you\'ll need a timer that re-sets after it shuts off..Not easy,but not impossible either!'}

In my washer the pump is on the right of the drain trap. Is this just an image thing? Also, I have the pump removed from the assembly, is there any reason...', 'answerType': '?', 'answer': 'The picture is actually upside down. The picture shows the mounting feet on the top while when installed in the machine the feet point down and are attached to the base of the washer. Another interesting aspect of the picture of a pump is that they managed to hide the attachment points of the two hoses. The inlet hose attaches to the back of the trap chamber on the left foreground of the picture. The trap keeps change and other debris from entering the pump. The pump itself is in the middle of the picture. The outlet extends at a 45 angle and cannot be seen becaust it is directly on the other side of the pump. The tan cap covers the motor and is normally on the right. Other than showing the pump rotated 180, the pump is in the correct orientation in the machine. You can open and empty the trap from the front without removing the pump. Removing the pump is tricky as you have to depress the black rubber padding on the feet in just the right way in order to remove the pump. Search YouTube for videos on how to do this. Be prepared for water! Since the pump is located at the bottom of the machine it cannot pump out all the water. Using a wet-vac to suck water out of the exaust tube gets rid of most of it.'}

If you cannot cut and paste the link, then go to "www.searspartsdirect.com" and enter your Model number in the search box, then go to the "Top and Cabinet" diagram, the suspension is item #10. After verifying the part, then I would go and find the best overall deal, (part + S/H + Tax). It does take a little work to get the old parts out, and the new parts in. Also in my washer, the "new" suspension part was a little different (well, more like improved). I\'m not sure about your Kenmore Washer, but I installed a new "improved" wash plate in my Whirlpool, and it seems to help reduce some of the twisting of clothing (the new impeller has three tall/long and three small "blades" and they are all narrow, the old impeller had three large/wide raised areas). Bottom line, my washer is as good as new, no more banging and "OL" codes. It was well worth the effort to save the big bucks of having someone come out... I used Google to find a service manual for my washer, it had some better info on how to open the washer, there were some self-help videos on Youtube as well. Best of luck!!!'}

I believe so! Being single and on a tight budget this has come in very handy! My apartment has my water and electric included in the rent so I purchased this washer and a spinner as well. I don't have to lug my laundry to the laundry room, hope I have enough money to wash and dry, nor do I have to worry about any of my clothes being stolen. The only small flaw that I have found this to have is that if you have thick plush towels the size of beach towels, it will not work correctly as the weight of the towel is too heavy for this, even if you just wash one at a time. I only have two such towels that I use when I go to the pool and all my other towels are the standard size and those I can wash two at a time. when it is time to wash my comforters which right now I am not using until winter time I will have to go to the laundry mat to wash those. But back to the plush towels, I just wash those by had in the kitchen sink and rinse them then I put them in the spinner and they will come out almost dry. I have gotten my monies worth on this product as I wash every week and I even wash my queen size bed sheets, flat and fitted in this washer, one at a time, of course of it beats them getting stolen from the washer in the laundry mat and having to buy new ones! I have also bought a grey colored hose from home depot to use to fill the washer faster with water because the hose it comes with is too small and it takes forever. I have only spent $6.00 for the hose and I have used both powder and also liquid detergent in this washer. If you like powder, fill washer first then add the powder and stir so the powder can dissolve, then add the close. It's just a little extra work but I would do it than spend $10 a week and having to sit there and wait for the clothes to wash, this way while I wash, I can do other house work or watch tv because once I don't hear the timer anymore then I know it stopped. I hope this helps! :) One more thing, if you can find a small table to sit it on, I have a small table that is lower than the sink but so this way when it's time to let the water out I just unhook the attached hose into the tub and let it drain. I don't even squeeze the excess water out of the clothes because you don't have to use more than a tablespoon of detergent. I just put clean water and set the timer to 15 minutes and let it rinse, then I let the water out again, take the clothes out and put it in the spinner and set that timer to two minutes and my clothes is clean and almost dry. I hang them to dry on hangers on this clothes rack and 30 minutes later, my clothes is dry. The thickness of the clothes depends on the time. I also set the clothes near the A/C vent so it dries quicker."}

It just slips onto it. If it doesn't fit your sink (it fits most sinks), then you could simply pour half gallon pitchers of water into it till you get it about 3/4 full. Put clothes in first and then fill it. When the wash cycle is over, place the drain house in the sink and let it drain and then refill it for the rinse cycle. Six minutes seems to get our clothes really clean. Then 3 minutes for the rinse cycle. Less time because you have less clothing in it than with a full size washer. Overfilling the machine with too many clothes makes agitation (movement of machine to clean) impossible. Overfilling with water will cause some water to leak out the drain hose which is hooked in an upward position during wash and rinse cycles to keep it from prematurely draining. Machine fits pretty easily on the counter next to sink. You need only a small amount of laundry soap for each wash. It does not spin dry the clothes. You will need to wring them out or buy a small spin dryer. You could also place the machine on a table or counter and put a bucket under it for when you need to drain it. You could fill it via a garden hose. It seems to work well with cold or warm water."}

They are very easy to access. I loosened the four screws that hold down the glass cover, lifted it up a bit and could easily see the light housings. They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn't immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can't figure out how they might be posted here."}

I did not use the screws that came with the range, JUNK. I used 3.5 inch deck screws with washers, total 8, drilled my own holes for the mounting plate. the most difficult task is connecting the vent tube, since it is metric and not standard, will be challenging because it will not fit into the 6 inch vent, need to stretch the vent collar. Just remember the vent is adjustable for height. get a piece of string and tape to ceiling and cut to length of range height. from the bottom of the string measure the distance from your stove top, is it within proper ventilation height requirements from stove top to the bottom of the hood range.

The water coming from faucet when not connected to d/w is highly pressurized. Is this normal?', 'answerType': 'Y', 'answer': 'In a word, yes. But if you\'re interested in the why/how, one may consider this: standard kitchen and bathroom faucets have a device located where the water exits, called an "aerator", which is usually comprised of a piece of steel screen, and a couple of metal or plastic components inside. This little gadget screws into the end of the faucet, precisely where you installed the adapter for the dishwasher. The purpose of this device is to intermix the exiting water with lots of air in order to increase the volume of the liquid by generating lots of little bubbles. This is why the water coming out of most faucets appears to be white and bubbly, instead of a steady, clear, stream like you would expect to see from the end of your garden hose. A faucet with an aerator produces a more controlled and gentle stream, and because the device mixes in lots of air, less water is needed in order to produce a steady and useful flow. In other words, aerators have the cumulative effect of drastically reducing both the volume of water and the exit speed of the water at the faucet. If you have noticed a difference in water pressure after installing the adapter for this dishwasher, I would venture to guess that you had one of these devices installed (99.9% of faucets do have one) and that you removed it in order to install the dishwasher adapter. So in summation, the good news is that if all my assumptions about your circumstance so far are correct, what you\'re experiencing is normal. The bad news (if it can be called bad?) is that you have to put up with a slightly more powerful, less ruley, stream of water coming out of your faucet. In that sense, it does represent a trade-off of sorts, however, it should also be pointed out that many people remove the aerators from the kitchen faucet on purpose, for the express purpose of achieving the higher pressure and flow that you\'re experiencing. Attempting to install the dishwasher adapter to the end of the aerator will not work because the dishwasher adapter will prevent any air from being drawn in to the aerator. If your faucet pressure is so high that it is a problem to use, the best advice would be to adjust the valves under your sink until you attain a more desirable rate of flow. I hope this helps!'}

I clean the inside of the rack where it sits at the side of the sink. I scrub and then tilt toward sink and use my sink sprayer to rinse. I do this with the bottom drainer tray back on the unit (after its been cleaned). That way all the water drains right out to the spout and into the sink as I spray. One area I can't get too is where the draining spout connects to the drain tray. Looks like it will get build up over time. I suspect I'll have to soak it or maybe put in dishwasher. Some of the pieces are dishwasher safe. I'm just not sure which ones but think it says on box. I have to check."}

No limit on how small you can go. You could put a 12 inch Cast Iron Fry Pan on it. but the size of the magnetic heating element under the glass is 7 inches in diameter so it only heats the center. Around the edge of the pan is not hot enough for max heat. A problem for saute, but not to boil water or slow cook, depends on what you\'re cooking. I use my 8 inch cast iron fry pan a lot. Our 4 qt capacity enameled cast iron Walmart LeCrueset knock-off works great as such bowl-shaped cookware has a smaller diameter area at the bottom. For serious cooking with a Wok you should use an extra large gas burner. Good quality Tri-clad cookware with the induction symbol stamped on the bottom such as Fagor cookware works very well and is not very expensive. I have a tall 8 1/2" diameter stockpot that holds 5-6 quarts that I use for soups, stews and slow cooking. The tri-clad bottom spreads the heat evenly, so thick stews don\'t burn on the low settings. Most six quart stainless steel Pressure cookers work OK, though you should only fill a P.C. 2/3 full. My nephew uses it on his Cabin Cruiser because it doesn\'t draw too much current.

This kit comes with the Main thermostat, 1 outdoor sensor and 1 Portable Comfort Control (PCC). The PCC can be moved around the house. In my case, I have a 2 story house and I keep the PCC in the second floor, at night when I am in the room I transfer the control from downstairs (main unit) to the PCC and the temperature in the room is kept at my preferred setting (Usually 78/79). There is a drawback: The Main thermostast and the PCC cannot be used at the same time in tandem, so you are reading the temp either from the main or from the PCC but not both at the same time. For example if I set downstairs to be 80 and the PCC to be 79 the A/C will not turn on to keep both settings, only to keep the one that at that moment is the master (either the main unit or the PCC). If you want to keep an average setting in your house, like having multiple sensors indoor and that the AC turns on to keep this average, then there are small indoor units (no screen) that are cheap that can be used for that.'}

Although, any sound that you are unaccustomed to, will disturb a good nights sleep. My experience has been, after having the YTHX in place for over 3 months, that your rest cycle will be less interrupted with the more familiar sound. However if you are a very light sleeper more drastic measures might be considered, such as replacing the thermosat to a more remote location. Fishing wires thru walls and ceilings is a moderate (experience level) undertaking. I had to run a fifth wire (previous 4-wire would not support the YTHX), and am familiar with the undertaking. If not, an ac or electrician can easily handle the issue. Good Luck."}

It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn't mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn't have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don't think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950's and 1960's when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don't have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away."}

Jeans/pants - You could put 4 in, but sweatpants, I\'d put 3, and again add some misc little stuff. With sheets - a fitted & flat queen sheet can go in together, but unfortunately sometimes it seems to cause one of them to somehow get caught over the center "swish" piece. So I typically wash one of them & add a bunch of other small stuff. Not for washing pillows or blankets - though you could toss a throw in. It does a good job, but the thing I hate most about it is if you keep it somewhere when not in use & then wheel it to a sink to hook up to water, the wheeling isn\'t the most smooth in the world. This is primarily related to the leveling knob on the side, which can pop out of the frame a lot. So if your load is imbalanced with a bigger item (if ya can fit it), that helps level it, but then is a pain in the neck. It cleans well, but it\'s definitely a moderate size closer to the small side than large. Hope that makes sense!'}

This dishwasher doesn't have a heating coil. Instead it dries items by heating up the water to around 160 degrees while rinsing so everything gets really hot; then drains the water; then the items (mostly) evaporate the water off because they are so hot. Plastic-ware will not melt at this temperature so your 'top rack' items can be put in there like all other items."}

This model has only 5 heat settings. I am completely satisfied. The units on TV are more sophisticated and more expensive. This Nesco is 1500 watts. I have tested this Nesco and it does not proportion the energy at its lower settings (like a microwave in defrost mode). Some do and can cause burning. Some more expensive I have seen are 1800 watts.

The UL10-U30 has "3-speed mechanical EZ push buttons"; no touch display, no delayed auto shut off and no remote control. the PX also offers sensor operation, and I don\'t see that listed among the features of the UL. Bells and whistles in terms of the controls is the primary difference as far as I can tell. As to whether it\'s a "true 900CFM", I can\'t tell you for certain, but I can tell you that I\'ve been extremely happy with the suction and smoke evacuation from this unit, not to mention the quietness. Installation was a bit of a bear, and definitely not one-man job. It\'s not overly "complicated", just that the unit is heavy and cumbersome and you definitely need to be methodical.

Mr/Ms Roby, if you don\'t understand the question, why did you write an answer? Ms Cowgirl, the Product Description says, "This amazing instant water heater can be connected to the existing hot water piping." So perhaps a better explanation is that YOU cannot hook it up to American piping. If NO ONE could hook it up to American piping, it wouldn\'t have a 4.4-star rating. Mr Curcie, what difference does it make WHY Ms O\'Meara wants it hotter? A shower is not the only way people use hot water. Folks running a food truck, for instance, might need hot water over 100 to make hot tea, instant coffee, wash their utensils, etc. Using the example in the Product Description, tap water coming in at 56 will be heated 45 to 101. This is NOT hot enough for hot drinks, as 101 is only 2.4 above body temperature. Great for baby formula; not great for coffee. If the 101 water from one unit can be run through a second unit, a 45 temperature rise will yield 146 water, which IS hot enough for coffee and hot tea. The biggest problem with Amazon\'s Q&As is people chiming in with "answers" when they don\'t really know the answer. So how about it? Does anyone (including the seller) actually know the answer to this question? Or are we supposed to be satisfied with "I don\'t know," "I don\'t understand," "I could only guess," and "Why would you want to?"'}

When I turn on my cold water to mix with the hot, I guess it reduces how much pressure I'm pulling from the heater so it turns off.

Therefore, it will not fit your machine hook ups or plug in parts, thus creating a leak or bad electrical connection. To be sure what part # is correct check the part number and match to the part number you are replacing. If there are no numbers on part you want to replace, look at the specific model and make of your machine and match that way. Each manufacturer has specific # on their parts for each model of machine they sell. Descriptions also in listing with part stating what machine or model they go with. Numbers could also be engraved on original part too. If you still aren't 100% sure it's the correct part for your machine, call the 800# for the manufacturer of your machine.

The "cooling output " plug has temperature settings that can be set,independently, for day and night and will control your a/c and/or fans (or ANY device that cools).dead band is adjustable.The cooling device does NOT need to have its own thermostat,but its better if it does ,if its an a/c or high power draw device. Just make absolutely sure you factor in the start up watts for the device and never exceed the rating.a good rule is to never go above 80% of the maximum.factor for the largest POSSIBLE load. The "night output" plug is always on at night(off during the day) and you can plug a heater in there but you would still need the heater to have its own thermostat,as the night output plug is always on at night. The "CO2 output" plug is a DAY recycle timer and controls whatever device you have plugged and cycle the power cycle on and off based on the "on time" and "off time" set.This timer is OFF during night. CO2 isnt used in high enough amounts to have on at night. The "humidity output" plug cycles whatever device you have plugged in based on the humidity settings. you can have seperate day and night humidity settings and you can select "humidity increase" or "humidity decrease" modes.one to humidify and one to de humidify. Dead band is adjustable. it also has a temp/humidity lock that lets you use fans to cool and remove humidity instead of the a/c.or split mode for using and a/c to cool and fans/dehumidifier to remove moisture. split mode allows independent control. you can also set it to turn off the co2 when the fans run.'}

My was an 6" duct and I end up going to Home Depot and get a reducer that cost about $12. I love how it look but installing it was a b*tch. It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn\'t feel secure for me. I don\'t wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn\'t going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1/4" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain. Even with toggle bolt I have to end reverse mount it to make it easier to screw nut into the toggle bolt.'}

I ALSO have the same dryer in my apartment (I live in a different place in the winter. Why? Have you every been in northern Wisconsin in the winter? HAHA) and I don't vent it.

In the instructions it said something like - if you prefer not to vent the dryer through a window, you may just enjoy the \'pleasant warming\' it will provide to your room. Must be cold year round in China, huh? I didn\'t mind a little \'warming\' in Jan-Feb. But it\'s in the 90\'s now in NYC. Don\'t think I\'d want to run it unvented in a windowless room today.

If you are keeping them in a mason jar there is a lot of O2 in there, especially if you are constantly opening the jar. Best way to use them is to plan ahead and use them only as needed. I use them when dehydrating vegetables or making jerky. I portion out the vegetables or jerky into vacuum bags, open the vacuum bag containing the Oxy-Sorbs, take out the number required and immediately reseal the bag containing them. I then put a Oxy-Sorb AND a desiccant packet into the vacuum bag with the product and seal it. I keep all the dehydrated products in PLASTIC .50 caliber ammo cans in a freezer, (labeled, dated, etc.) and have found NO deterioration in the products for over 3 years.

Allow it to sit and hour or two unplugged, and then empty out all water you may have put in the machine. Put new water into the reservoir making certain you do not fill it above the maximum fill line. Distilled water is best, and will save you time down the road from having to clean off excessive mineral deposits from the freezing elements, but at minimum use good filtered water and not the junk that comes straight from the faucet. Next, plug the machine back in and press the power button. Do not attempt to set the clock or the timer. Ignore those buttons completely. Select your ice size (it really doesn't matter which one you choose just to test the machine - any size will do.) You should almost immediately hear the machine pumping water from the reservoir into the freezing chamber. It will sound like water quietly trickling and lasts a couple of seconds. If you hear that, you know the pump is working. You should also hear the compressor kick on after the water has been pumped into the freezing chamber, and if you place your hand next to the the exhaust port you ought to begin feeling slightly warmed air blowing out. Within 10 to 12 minutes your first batch of ice will be done. You hear very audibly when the machine slides the ice off the freezing elements and they tumble onto a temporary holding platform. Then you will hear the ice being raised up on the platform and pushed off of it down into the catch basket. The clattering of the ice is unmistakable. If these things do not happen within 12 to 15 minutes of when you turned the power on, something is not right with the machine. You'll most likely need to notify Amazon and have it replaced."}

Is it possible with this ice maker?", 'answerType': '?', 'answer': 'To answer your question, I must address your concerns about "white" and "bitter-flavor" separately. Yes, these ice cubes are white, not crystal clear. The white color is from air entrapped as the cubes form on the refrigerated rods. The entrapped air makes the ice cubes "soft" and easily chewed if you are inclined to chew ice. We love this consistency. These ice cubes do not, however, have a bitter flavor.

Carefully unclip Part #11 from the rack and slide down ward until it will unclip from the rack adjuster. Mine were very brittle from age and I snapped one off. Remove second retaining clip part #12. Hard to explain how to do this, but it is not difficult. Release the middle of it, slide it upward and and it will come off. Remove the last retainer, part #9. I used a small screw driver to assist in releasing it. Next use a small screw driver to pry apart parts 8 & 10. The top part is tabbed and the bottom part snaps together so I gently pried it apart from the bottom sides (there was a small notch i could easily get into). The rack adjuster will now slide off.

The lint filter is a useless, don't hold nothing! Please I need help with the lint.", 'answer': "I've had this machine for over a year, it works great but if you have clothes that tend to shed a lot you will have lint issues. in this machine it only takes a few minutes to was clothes. It is not like the regular washers. As a rule of thumb if it is an item being washed just because I wore it once I use the three minute cycle, if I wore it outside and it got dirty I adjust the time accordingly. Lightly dirty about 6 minutes, moderate dirty 9 minutes and heavy grime 12 minutes. You will have to play with the times and degree of dirtyness. Overall these are great machines for an apartment dweller. Unfortunately they do have some limits. If you are getting a lot of lint, try decreaseing the time especially if the clothing is not grimey. Usually an item worn on one or two days just needs a light washing in this machine. I usually run the extractor for 2 minutes. Most loads take a total of 5 minutes start to finish."}

If there is too much, nothing moves. Bathtowels-large only 2. Smaller towels 4-5 plus washrags. most loads are best if they are combinations of face towels, washrags, shorts and shirts. 2 shirts, 2 shorts, 3 face towels, and multiple washrags fits fine. If you do sheets, one at a time with something else is best. If you wash both at a time, which you can they fit, they get wrapped up in each other and neither gets washed. Hope that helps.'}

Is the washer part larger, easier to use? Already use the Panda with separate spinner; would there be any benefit in getting this unit to replace existing arrangement?', 'answer': 'This is not actually a newer model, but rather a different one. The washer is a bit larger I would say, but in practicality it has the same power. The built in spinner allows for easy transfer of sopping wet clothing without drips on the floor. You can even pull them out of the wash basin while it is still full and throw them right in the spinner to do a rinse and dry. In the end though, if you are thinking about putting down another $150ish bucks when you already have the standalone panda, I would HIGHLY recommend getting the 3,200 RPM spinner with the stainless drum here on Amazon. It is somewhere around that price, but it can hold an entire load from the Panda, and will dry the clothes to almost 100% dry in just a few minutes. This dual unit has a 120 watt 1,300 RPM (The smaller stand alone spinner is actually faster at 1,600 RPM!) spinner that holds less than half of one load from the washing side. The 3,200 RPM one has 400 watts of power and can hold over 11lbs of clothes! Unless the drain pump is super important to you I would skip this one. If I were you I would keep the stand alone Panda and upgrade your dryer! :) Hope this helps!'}

There are five cycles to choose from, and once you choose a cycle you can also choose from four options (but you don't have to choose an option). Here are the cycle times: a) Heavy - 2:15, b) Auto - 2:09, c) Normal - 2:15, d) Express - 0:30, and e) Rinse - 0:09. If you choose one of the options, these are the cycle times (based on choosing the Normal cycle): a) Half load - 1:39, b) Delicate - 1:28, c) Sanitize - 1:48, and d) Extra Shine - 2:08. I usually use the Auto cycle with no option selected. Keep in mind that unless you wait until right before you need your dishes to wash them, the long cycle time isn't really an issue because the machine is so quiet that you can't even tell it's running. I've had mine for three months now and would absolutely buy it again. In three months, I've only had to rewash a dish perhaps twice - and it was a dish with stuck on food. Glasses come out sparkly. And I've found that using liquid Cascade instead of Finish gel packs gets the dishes just as clean (the liquid stuff is less expensive). Just make sure you use Jet Dry liquid (NOT the solid that hangs in a basket - that stuff is horrible) - it does make a difference. Hope this helps!"}

I would guess the hoses are 5-6 feet long. I would recommend you google the install manual and take a look at that. The electrical hookup is via a junction box, so you need to make sure you have room and accommodations for that. This is by far the best dishwasher I've ever owned, by the way.

Since the racks are wire, they can bend and flex to give you a bit more room. I wouldn't worry about space issues with this dishwasher. It is very roomy and it never ceases to amaze me how much more capacity it has than our previous dishwasher. You can dramatically increase the space by moving the drawer racks up and down or removing the utensil basket. I wouldn't hesitate for a second on this purchase. It's quiet, roomy and dependable. If you think the price is high, consider its resale value. Bosch dishwashers are highly desirable and are often snapped up quickly on classifieds.

There is a latching type molex connector all the way in the back corner and there is very little room for your fingers to press the tab and pull at the same time.

Yes the exhaust tubing is plastic but I used it since I was dumping the exhaust right from the until to the ouside and a metal smoke elbow would not be enough to make it through the wall and to try to make up the difference with metal would have been more work then needed. If your going to discharge the exhaust higher up (more then a foot) then use the metal smoke pipe it cuts down on the loss of CFM since it us smooth inside where as the plastic is ribbed for flexing.

With "Cover Control" you don\'t need to wire in a switch. You connect the tailpiece of the InSinkErator to your drain through a U-shaped trap.

Is there a kit required?', 'answerType': '?', 'answer': 'I\'m sorry but I do not understand your question. "Slide ins" are by nature "stand alone" The primary difference from traditional ranges is that they are designed to be placed within a cabinet opening designed to present an integrated appearance. Thus the range top has edges that form a 3/4 inch flange over the counter-top so that cooking spills do not leak down the sides. The counter top opening therefore must conform to the size required by the range (both width and height). Do not confuse "slide in" with "drop in" Make sure your counter height and width conform to the required spec or that you can alter it to bring it into spec. Ours fit in perfectly and my wife is overjoyed with it. Google "slide in vs drop in" in if you are confused over the difference between them. Also make sure that all of your cookware has enough ferrous (iron) material to allow a magnet to stick firmly to the base or the induction range will not work with it. Ours heats a proper saucepan filled with water to a full boil in less then two minutes. Its very responsive. I would not recommend this range to be used without a counter-top at each of its sides. The glass cook-top would have exposed edges that normally lie upon the counter-top and are therefore well protected from possible physical strikes resulting in consequent damage or breakage. Additionally the sides, while painted, are not designed to be exposed to view such as a standard range sitting at the end of a counter with one side exposed to view where a finished surface on the side of the range is desirable.'}

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B00G9EHGDK', 'answerTime': 'Sep 20, 2014', 'unixTime': 1411196400, 'question': 'Can it wash 1 or 2 towels at a time?', 'answer': "I have owned this machine for a few months now, and consider it a great purchase. I will answer your question, though ... by explaining how I use it because I have gone through quite a bit of trial and error, and now set it up in the best way that works for me. First I get the lid to a large plastic tote bins that I have. ( Something you can find at probably every dollar store, Walmart etc ) and lay it TOP DOWN in my bathtub. This prevents the water from submerging the bottom of the machine in any way. Then, I fill the washer side ( making sure the dial is set on WASH first ) using the hand held shower head I have. It works just fine. I don't need to use any fancy hoses, levers, etc. I know a lot of people out there do that. This works best for me. As for soap, I either dilute a laundry pod ( as I have a bunch of them anyway ) in SIX CUPS of water ( you will have TONS left over ) and use 1 TEASPOON of that, per load .. or one teaspoon of regular liquid laundry soap. I usually turn on the machine about half a second just to see suds in the water.. I don't think it's needed though. Now, this is what I do per clothing item per load: ( for two people living in my home ) - NO MORE then 5-6 tops - NO MORE then 3-4 pants ( depending on their thickness. Jeans, two per load ) - Under clothing items, I always have a lot and I always throw them all in, but be prepared to untangle socks .. so if you do not want to do that,do your socks in small loads orput them into a THICKKKKKKKKKKKK laundry bag. ( I say thick because this machine will tear the regular small ones to absolute shreds ) - Bedding, yep, bedding ... I do the cover sheet AND the top sheet together. If you want, it can handle two pillow cases along with. I don't do that, I wash the pillow cases ( cuz there is four total ) with my tops. Works fine. - Do not, do not, do NOT wash ANY blankets in this machine other then baby blankets. - Towels .. now we have standard, large towels and I will NEVER again put more then two in at a time. As well, I will NEVER put more then 3/4th a teaspoon of laundry soap in with the towels because they REALLY REALLY suds up the machine. It doesn't matter how may times you rinse, it causes tons of suds. You will be rinsing for hours, or have to take the towels out and rinse by hand. I do all wash clothes, dish towels, hand towels together. ( Usually 7-9 pieces total ) The times I have found that work best per clothing item per load: (Seriously, screw what the numbers say or what the booklet suggests ) Tops - 5-7 minutes if you have heavily soiled tops, I don't see an issue with going as much as 9 minutes. Also, if they are delitcate tops, lace, etc .. 3-4 works fine. Pants - 7-10 minutes. Heavily soiled, 10 might still be enough, but go ahead and add more if they are like muddy, etc. ( In which case, you don't wannal oad the machine up too much with mud etc) Under clothing - I run em the full 15 minutes. Works great. Towels, 13-15. After washing is done, drain. Then refill to rinse. You have to do this or your clothes are gonna be sudsy. Go ahead and leave clothing in machine while your draining and refilling. Then, run the rinse for HALF the amount of time you just washed. Then drain the machine again, take cloths out of the wash and put into the spinner. Now, for every load, you wanna SPLIT it in half to spit. For example, if you just washed four pairs of thin pants, put two in at a time. ( The spin side is smaller anyway ) Five shirts, two first, then three next. Towels ONE AT A TIME. The hand towels and etc, I spin all at once , or split in two loads, it works fine. Then hang up or throw in dryer if you have one. Now it was dead of summer where I live when I got this and its cooled now to 80s ... our clothes take the entire day to dry, unless you got a fan blowing on it. I have hung laundry on hangers for more then ten years, so this does not bother me. I know I have said lots here but I truly love this machine. It has saved money at the laundrymat and saves energy... however, be prepared to be messing with your machine quite awhile on laundry day unless you use it for washing odds and ends. Also, I would STRONGLY advise NOT using any liquid fabric softner. I am very sensitive to the stuff personally, but can tell ya, this machine doesn't really get it out real well. Good luck!"}

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B00G9EHGDK', 'answerTime': 'Nov 21, 2014', 'unixTime': 1416556800, 'question': 'how to use it without getting caught by the owner water usage i want to buy one', 'answer': "It's a small enough machine so you can hide it in your closet when not in use. Not too noisy either. Water usage is about 1.5-2 buckets full of water, plus what you use for rinsing. It's less than what you'd use filling up your bathtub for a bath... When I use this, I use the method we used to use when I was a child and haven't had an automated washer. This method will save you water, too. : Fill the washer part with water. Warmer water should be used for whites. Fill up a bucket or a children size tub with colder water for rinsing. Separate your laundry by colours, and start the wash with whites. When the whites are done, twist them over the washer, so the water will stay in the washer, then put the laundry into the bucket filled for rinsing. Then put the next, darker coloured bunch of laundry into the same water in the washer. Wash it, and during that rinse you whites in the bucket, then twist or squeeze them before placing them in the spining part of the machine. Once spinned, shake the items to reduce wrinkles, then hang them on a drying rack or wire or hanger to dry. Same to do with the darker colours. As you get ahead with the process, the water temperature will be reduced as well by time. You'll save water, gas or electricity to heat the water and probably time as well. As said earlier, for one wash for all or most colours you use less water than using by having a bath or a long shower. Obviously if it is more than one person's laundry, you might need a bit more water and time, but the amount of water used will be still less than having a bath each. I hope this helps. And one more thing. Sometimes landlords don't want washers installed in apartments, because of lack of space or because they are afraid of leakage. I can assure you that you can spill more water by handwashing your stuff at home in the bathroom than by using this washer carefully, not to mention that those landlords would not think of such options as this portable washer. I'd might go to my landlord and ask for permission, rather than hiding it and doing laundry secretly. But all circumstances differ as all people are different."}

How long will they keep staple foods such as beans, rice and lentils fresh?', 'answer': 'Hello, All Mylar bags must be heat-sealed to be effective. There are a few ways of doing this but I think the most common is to simply use a household iron. I have also heard of using a hair iron, which should work as long as it gets hot enough. The recommended sealing temperature is 400 degrees. They sell impulse sealers that work well but are not really worth it unless you plan on sealing a lot of bags. We usually recommend you rotate your food supply every year or two by actually using it. However, when properly sealed, low moisture food like you are storing can stay fresh indefinitely as it is protected from oxidation, bugs, light, mold, and oxygen dependent organisms. If you plan on extended storage, be sure to use quality American Mylar as small holes in the foil layer can let oxygen in whether the bag has been punctured or not, no matter how thick the entire laminate material is. A Long-Term Food Storage Guide is included with PackFresh products and you are always welcome to send us your questions as well. Have a great day!'}

{'questionType': 'open-ended', 'asin': 'B00IB7AXAQ', 'answerTime': 'Oct 7, 2014', 'unixTime': 1412665200, 'question': 'Could you be more clear regarding holes in the mylar vs holes in the foil and what makes your product superior?', 'answer': 'Sure, I am happy to. There is a popular misconception that there is one Mylar film and the thicker, the better. Actually, there are many kinds of Mylar films which consist of layers of different materials that serve different purposes. Mylar itself is a transparent member of the polyester family that is remarkably strong. The Mylar in this film has a bursting strength of 69 pounds per square inch so it can withstand a lot of abuse. In order to make the film a protective barrier to oxygen, a foil layer is added. (oxygen cannot go through glass or metal) This foil layer can be disturbed by folding, moving or filling the bag and you can sometimes see a scratch or a separation during regular use but these are not holes in the film and do not significantly effect the performance of the bag. Mylar bags from Pack Fresh are made here in Southern California and have never been shipped until you buy them. That is how we can afford to compete with the other discount "mylar" that comes from China. There are some enlightening Washington Post articles that should make it clear why American-made products such as those from Pack Fresh are superior.

Are the bags shipped so that they do not get creased causing leaks?', 'answerType': '?', 'answer': "Hello, I am glad you asked this here so that others can read this as well because this pops up from time to time. Mylar is one of the toughest flexible materials ever created. The film we use to make these can take the weight of two and a half cinder blocks EVERY square inch... and folding does not hurt it. (Still, we do ship orders of 3 or more in a large box as long as it is not Fulfilled by Amazon) But Mylar film is transparent. It looks metallic because a separate layer of aluminum has been added to the Mylar. Normal use, even filling it or moving it, will cause tiny breaks in the foil layer that you may sometimes see if you hold it to the light - but don't worry, they are not holes. This happens with all Mylarfoil films and their barrier properties are not significantly effected . I'm glad you didn't forget your best friend!

Problem is the bucket the ice goes in is small, and once it's full it stops making ice until you empty it. So, if you stood there and babysat it, emptying the ice into your ice bin every 20 minutes or so, you could fill a large bin in less than 2 hours.

Woder Undersink Water Filter is an Antimicrobial Water Treatment Unit (Granulated carbon with an anti-microbial agent ) of Premium Quality Water Filtration That Exceeds Industry Standards of Both NSF and ANSI. As Mentioned on The Filter Itself, The Inert Ingredient Is 'Clearbrook Gen II Formula'. Being bacteriostatic or maintaining bacteriostasis is important in any filter because it keeps organisms from self forming in filters like the algae and and various parasites similar to what you find in swimming pools once chemicals diminish. The test protocols are not published. The description itself as seen on Amazon makes a summary of the reports. The formula is tested to the EPA Protocol for Microbiological Purifiers by the University of Arizona and by Spectrum Labs in accordance with the relevant ANSI/NSF Protocols. The Woder is manufactured for removal of VOCs and Heavy Metals. It is a granular form filter with integrated diffuser that keeps the water from channeling which is typical of this type filter. In addition, the formula is of the type that is used in industrial applications for removal of high volumes at larger concentrations of contaminants. Obviously...these industrial impacts are not typically found in drinking water so the capacity of the filter is extended"}

How can we know they are safe?', 'answer': "'Woder' is a Clearbrook LLC / Sunrise Solutions LLC's Brand Name. The Woder website address can be found easily on each filter (Woder dot biz). Woder Filters manufactured using NSF listed components and in compliance with NSF standards. The people of Woder believe a costly certification by NSF does not provide the consumer any value, rather it only serves to increase the cost of each unit. In addition, since NSF Certifications are not required (by any Governmental Agency) in order to market water filtration products, Woder chose to keep consumer costs down while maintaining high production & filtration standards. All of Woder filters either meet or exceed NSF filtration standards & protocols for each respective filter. Woder filters are EPA certified. Woder's inline water filter (Woder 5K), is EPA certified (EPA Est. No. 51160-Al01). The filter itself is made in the USA and supervised by the relevant authorities. Woder 5K removes 99.99% of contaminants, ie mercury, Chlorine, Contaminants, lead, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, toxic TTHMs and VOCs.
